An interactive, AI-powered desktop assistant in the style of Rem from *Re:Zero*. This character lives on your desktop, visually analyzing your screen to interact with icons and windows, responding to your voice commands, and performing a wide range of tasks. She'll stay on your desktop, ready to assist with tasks, answer questions, or just keep you company.

*A GIF showcasing the assistant in action would be a great addition here!*

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Visual Awareness**: Powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash, Rem can "see" your screen, identify icons or windows, and decide to move towards them.
*   **Voice Control**: Activate her by calling her wake word ("Rem" by default) and give commands in natural language.
*   **Dynamically Extensible Commands**: Add new, complex skills by simply editing a JSON file, without touching the core Python code. The AI will learn the "recipe" and generate the necessary code on the fly.
*   **Core Assistant Tools**:
    *   üéµ **Spotify Control**: Play, pause, and skip tracks.
    *   üå¶Ô∏è **Weather Information**: Get the current weather for any city.
    *   üåê **Web Search**: Ask questions and get summarized answers from the web.
    *   üíª **Code Execution**: Ask her to perform system tasks by generating and running Python scripts securely.
*   **Customizable**: Easily change the wake word, character animations, and more.

## üöÄ Getting Started

There are two ways to get Rem running on your Windows machine.

### Method 1: Easy Installation (Recommended for Most Users)

This is the simplest way to get started. You just need to download the pre-built program.

1.  **Download the Latest Release**
    *   Go to the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/JuuzouTem/Rem/releases/latest)**.
    *   Under the "Assets" section, download the `Rem-Assistant.exe` file.

2.  **Create the Configuration File**
    *   In the **same folder** where you saved `Rem-Assistant.exe`, create a new text file and name it `config.ini`.
    *   Copy and paste the following template into your new `config.ini` file:
      ```ini
      [Gemini]
      api_key = YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE

      [Assistant]
      wake_word = rem
      text_input_speak_response = true

      [Spotify]
      client_id = YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE
      client_secret = YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
      redirect_uri = http://localhost:8888/callback
      ```

3.  **Add Your API Keys**
    *   Follow the instructions in the **[Configuration (`config.ini`)](#-configuration-configini)** section below to get your API keys and add them to the file.

4.  **Run the Assistant**
    *   Double-click `Rem-Assistant.exe`. Rem should now appear on your desktop!

### Method 2: Installation from Source (For Developers)

If you want to modify the code or run it directly with Python.

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JuuzouTem/Rem.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**
    The project files are inside a sub-folder.
    ```bash
    cd Rem/Rem
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install google-generativeai pygame gtts pygetwindow pyautogui Pillow speechrecognition spotipy
    ```

4.  **Configure API Keys**
    *   In the `Rem/Rem` folder, create a `config.ini` file.
    *   Follow the instructions in the **[Configuration (`config.ini`)](#-configuration-configini)** section below to fill it with your keys.

5.  **Run the Assistant**
    ```bash
    python assistant.py
    ```

## üîß Configuration (`config.ini`)

To use the AI and Spotify features, you must get your own free API keys.

#### ‚ôä Gemini API Key (for AI Brain)

1.  Go to **[Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)**.
2.  Click the "**Create API key**" button.
3.  Copy the generated API key and paste it into the `api_key` field in your `config.ini`.

#### üéµ Spotify API (for Music Control)

1.  Go to the **[Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)** and log in.
2.  Click "**Create app**", give it a name and description.
3.  Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into your `config.ini`.
4.  **Crucially**, click the "**Settings**" button for your app.
5.  In the "**Redirect URIs**" field, add **exactly** this URL: `http://localhost:8888/callback`. Click "Add", then "Save".

**First-Time Authorization**: The very first time you ask Rem to control Spotify, a browser window will open asking you to grant permission. Please accept it. This only needs to be done once.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing and Adding New Skills

The most powerful feature of this assistant is its ability to learn new tasks without changing the code. You can teach Rem new skills by editing the `special_commands.json` file.

This file acts as a "recipe book" for the AI. When you give a command that matches a recipe, the AI will generate and execute a Python script to complete the task.

**Example: Adding a "System Backup" Command**

1.  **Open `special_commands.json`** and add a new entry:

    ```json
    {
      "...": "...",
      "create_backup": "Creates a backup of the 'MyDocuments' folder by zipping it to the Desktop. Use python's 'shutil' library, specifically 'shutil.make_archive'. The backup should be named 'docs_backup'."
    }
    ```

2.  **Run the assistant and say**: "Rem, create a backup of my documents."

The AI will now understand this new recipe. It will generate the necessary `shutil` Python code to create the zip file and ask for your permission to run it.
